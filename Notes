/*divs and spans 
-Use spans in paragraphs to change fonts, colors, sizes. 
-Do not use a div to change that.
*Need to give divs a class <div class=""> do this in html
    - class is the name of the div 
    -to seclect a class in css put .className {

You can have a class for your div and then a classes for 
 elements in that div
<div class="top">
        <p class="intro"> 
            efhtg fbfg <span class= highlight> highlight this </span>
you can also use <div id="top-section"> *There can only be one id per page. 
You can't have two "top-section" on the same page. 
- In CSS id is #top-section { 
*/

/* CSS Box Model 
- For each box you have: *do in this order
    -Margin - margin-top, -bottom,-left,-right
        *marigin is pushing away creating empty space
    -Border - border width, style, color
        *shorthand ex/ border: 5px solid green;
    -Padding
        * Padding is creating empty space with background color
        - padding-top, -right, -bottom, -left *clockwise from top
            * padding: 10px 15px 15px 5px
*/

/*Backgorund Image in css 
.class{
    background-image: url(../img/hamster.jpg);  
    *../ means that it is going back from css folder to img folder
    must have that for it to work
        - Might need to use padding in order to get your img to look
    good in box
        - OR background-repeat: no-repeat;
                                : repeat-x: repeats on x-axis;
                                :repeat-y: repeasts up and down;

        - background-size: contain; fills space with image in proportion,
        it will repeat the image where it cannot fill proportionally
        - .....: cover; covers entir div with the picture. ***Best option but
        may lose some quality
        - background postion: center; *center of image is postioned in the 
        center of the div

img{
    float: left or rightd; *give a margin so that whatever the image is floating
    arond does not touch the image. 
    clear: both; for things around the float makes it go below the floating 
    objects.
